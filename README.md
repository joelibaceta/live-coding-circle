## Inspiration
Each community have experts and apprentices but they can not always be in the same place at the same time, so we developed a LiveCoding Circles to help to bring mentors creating learning groups (circles) beetween people between people from different regions, places or realities democratizing learning.

## What it does
We offer an interactive online editor to allow share an snippet or explain an algorithm bringing experts closer with apprentices in a virtual pair programming experience and chatroom environment, the mentor can assist a student at any time or place, with any coding problem.

## How I built it
We build using Customer Chat SDK to develop the chat room experience into the live coding editor.
We made an small hack with Messenger Bot for act as a chat room manager.

## Challenges
- [Use Customer Chat SDK](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/discovery/customer-chat-plugin/sdk) (Beta) for the first time. 
- Find a new way to use Messenger Bot to connect people.
- Build a useful live code editor
- Achieve perfect code edition synchrony using websockets

## What's next for live-coding-circle
- Live Code execution, using docker images to run containers with the main stacks in the live session.
- Video & Audio streaming to improve the experience
-Allow to embed an snippet in another site
